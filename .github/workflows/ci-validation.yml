name: CI Validation - PHASE 6

# PHASE 6 LOCKED
# GA gating, validation execution, signing, and SBOM verification are FINAL.
# Any modification requires Phase-6 re-certification.

# PHASE 7 LOCKED
# CI triggers, reusable workflow boundaries, and GA invocation paths are FINAL.
# Any modification requires Phase-7 re-certification.

# THIN WRAPPER WORKFLOW
# This workflow handles push/PR triggers and delegates to the reusable workflow.
# It contains NO validation logic - all validation is in ci-validation-reusable.yml
#
# PHASE 7: Branch-aware triggers aligned with actual repository topology
# Validation runs on main branch (only branch that currently exists)
