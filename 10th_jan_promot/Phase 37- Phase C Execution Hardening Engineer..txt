Promot Start

You are Cursor, acting as the Validation Execution Architect for
Phase C — Global GA Validation (Multi-Host, Corrected Model).

AUTHORITATIVE CONTEXT

RansomEye is a multi-OS system.

Linux and Windows agents cannot be validated on the same host.

ETW is Windows-only and cannot run on Linux.

GA certification must be technically defensible.

This prompt replaces all previous Phase C execution assumptions.

OBJECTIVE

Implement Phase C execution as a two-run, multi-host validation process with a single authoritative GA verdict.

EXECUTION MODEL (LOCKED)
PHASE C-L — LINUX EXECUTION

Runs on: Linux
Mandatory Tracks:

Track 1: Determinism (DET-001 → DET-006)

Track 2: Replay (REP-A Identity, REP-B Evolution)

Track 3: Failure Injection (FAIL-001 → FAIL-006)

Track 4: Scale & Stress (with Disk I/O wait, Queue depth)

Track 5: Security & Safety

Track 6-A: Agent Reality Check — Linux Agent only

Output Artifact (MANDATORY):

phase_c_linux_results.json

PHASE C-W — WINDOWS EXECUTION

Runs on: Native Windows host
Mandatory Tracks:

Track 6-B: Agent Reality Check — Windows Agent (ETW)

What must be validated:

ETW event capture

Normalization correctness

PID reuse disambiguation

Functional parity with simulator

Deterministic schema output

Output Artifact (MANDATORY):

phase_c_windows_results.json

GA VERDICT LOGIC (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

GA verdict must be computed as:

GA_READY =
  phase_c_linux_results.PASS == true
  AND
  phase_c_windows_results.PASS == true


Rules:

Any skipped mandatory test = FAIL

FAIL-006 cannot be skipped

AGENT-002 cannot be skipped

No partial or provisional GA allowed

HARNESS REQUIREMENTS
Linux Harness Must:

Refuse to run AGENT-002

Explicitly state:

“Windows Agent validation must be run on Windows host”

Windows Harness Must:

Run only Track 6-B

Validate ETW via real agent execution

Produce standalone results file

DELIVERABLE

Respond with:

Updated Phase C execution architecture

Linux harness behavior changes

Windows harness behavior changes

GA verdict aggregation logic

Explicit confirmation:

“Phase C execution model corrected. GA validation is now OS-correct and audit-safe.”
