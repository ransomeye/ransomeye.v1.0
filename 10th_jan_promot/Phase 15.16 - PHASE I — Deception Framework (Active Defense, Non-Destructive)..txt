****Promot Start****

You are continuing **RansomEye — Military-Grade Enterprise Cyber Defense Platform**.
All previous subsystems are **authoritative, frozen, deterministic, validator-verifiable**.

This is **PHASE I — Deception Framework (Active Defense, Non-Destructive)**.

This phase introduces **controlled deception** to **observe attacker behavior**, not to block, exploit, or retaliate.

---

## OBJECTIVE

Build a **Deception Framework** that:

* Deploys **decoy assets** (hosts, services, credentials, files)
* Attracts attacker interaction
* Generates **high-confidence signals**
* Produces **evidence-grade telemetry**
* Never interferes with production assets

Deception is **observation with intent**, not enforcement.

---

## ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

* ❌ No counter-attacks
* ❌ No malware execution
* ❌ No real credential exposure
* ❌ No production host modification
* ❌ No automatic blocking
* ❌ No retaliation logic
* ❌ No background autonomy
* ❌ No dynamic learning or ML here

Everything is **explicit, deterministic, reversible**.

## DECOY TYPES (MANDATORY)

Must support **all** below, each as **data-defined**, not code:

1. **Host Decoys**

   * Fake Linux/Windows hosts
   * Never real production IPs

2. **Service Decoys**

   * Fake SSH / SMB / HTTP banners
   * Banner-only, no real backend

3. **Credential Decoys**

   * Honey credentials
   * Cryptographically tagged
   * Never valid in real systems

4. **File / Artifact Decoys**

   * Fake configs, keys, documents
   * Read-only access

---

## INTERACTION CAPTURE

Every interaction must record:

* Decoy ID
* Interaction type (auth_attempt, scan, access, command)
* Source (IP, host, process)
* Timestamp
* Evidence reference
* Confidence level (HIGH by default)

No interaction is dropped.
No aggregation at capture time.

---

## SIGNAL REQUIREMENTS

Signals produced by deception must be:

* **High confidence by design**
* Deterministic
* Explicitly explainable
* Chain-of-custody protected

Signals flow into:

* KillChain & Forensics
* Threat Graph
* Risk Index
* Alert Engine
* System Explanation Engine (SEE)

---

## REQUIRED INTEGRATIONS

Deception Framework MUST integrate with:

* Audit Ledger (deployment, interaction, teardown)
* Network Scanner (topology-aware placement)
* Linux Agent (host-level decoys)
* Threat Graph (entity + edge creation)
* KillChain & Forensics (evidence)
* Global Validator (replayability)

---

## PASS / FAIL

PASS only if:

* Decoys are isolated from production
* No real credentials are exposed
* Same deployment → same behavior
* Interactions are immutable facts
* Signals are deterministic and explainable
* Validator can replay interactions

FAIL if:

* Any real asset is touched
* Any exploit logic exists
* Any automatic retaliation exists
* Any nondeterminism appears

---

## OUTPUT EXPECTATION

* Production-grade **Deception Framework**
* Frozen schemas
* Explicit deployment
* Evidence-grade interaction capture
* High-confidence signals
* Ready for **Phase J — Threat Intel Feed & IOC Engine**

Do **not** build Threat Intel yet.
Do **not** add blocking or remediation.
Do **not** add ML.

Build **Deception Framework only**.
