Promot Start

You are Cursor, acting as the Validation & Assurance Engineer for
Phase C — Global GA Validation & Determinism Proof (Corrected).

AUTHORITATIVE CONTEXT

Core Engine, DPI Probe, Linux Agent, Windows Agent are implemented.

Phase B forensic summarization is implemented and corrected.

Data plane is hardened and frozen.

LLM output is governed by semantic determinism, not byte equality.

This phase determines GA eligibility.

OBJECTIVE

Prove that RansomEye is GA-ready through correct, realistic, and technically valid validation.

MANDATORY VALIDATION TRACKS (ALL REQUIRED)
TRACK 1 — DETERMINISM (CORRECTED)

DET-001: Detection determinism (Agent → raw_events)
DET-002: Normalization determinism (raw_events → normalized)
DET-003: Correlation determinism (normalized → incidents)
DET-004: Forensic summarization determinism (incidents → summaries)
DET-005: LLM semantic determinism

Rules:

Non-LLM paths → hash equality required

LLM paths → schema + semantic equivalence only

Forbidden language checks mandatory

Structure, ordering, and exclusions must match

TRACK 2 — REPLAY & REHYDRATION (SPLIT MODES)

REP-A — Identity Replay

Same code

Same schemas

Bit-exact hashes required

REP-B — Evolution Replay

New code version

Same inputs

Semantic equivalence required

Hash equality NOT required

Both modes must pass.

TRACK 3 — FAILURE INJECTION

FAIL-001: DB connection loss
FAIL-002: Agent disconnect
FAIL-003: Queue overflow
FAIL-004: Duplicate events
FAIL-005: Partial writes
FAIL-006: DB restart mid-processing

Pass criteria:

No corruption

No silent loss

Explicit degradation only

TRACK 4 — SCALE & STRESS (REALISTIC)

SCALE-001: Burst ingestion
SCALE-002: Sustained load (1M+ events)
SCALE-003: Mixed traffic (ETW + DPI + Agent)
SCALE-004: Co-located deployment
SCALE-005: Backpressure recovery

Latency targets (LOCKED):

p50 < 1s

p95 < 3s

p99 < 5s

TRACK 5 — SECURITY & SAFETY

SEC-001: Enforcement authority verification
SEC-002: Signed execution verification
SEC-003: No direct table access
SEC-004: RBAC enforcement
SEC-005: Data-plane ownership enforcement
SEC-006: Audit ledger integrity

TRACK 6 — AGENT REALITY CHECK (NEW)

AGENT-001: Linux real agent vs simulator
AGENT-002: Windows real agent vs simulator

Requirement:

Structural and semantic equivalence

No simulator-only assumptions allowed

DELIVERABLE

Respond with:

Corrected validation plan

Test execution results

Metrics collected

Pass / Fail per track

Explicit GA verdict

End with:

“Phase C validation complete. GA decision ready.”
