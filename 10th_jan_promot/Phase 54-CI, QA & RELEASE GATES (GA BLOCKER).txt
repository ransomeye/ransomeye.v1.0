Prompt Start

You are fixing PHASE 6 — CI, QA & RELEASE GATES for RansomEye.

This phase is GA-BLOCKING.
No release, no installer, no package may exist without this phase being PASS.

OBJECTIVE

Make it impossible to ship a broken, unsigned, or non-compliant build.

After this phase:

CI must fail-closed

Releases must be cryptographically gated

No manual bypass without audit

No unsigned artifact can exist

MANDATORY FIXES (ALL REQUIRED)
1. CI Fail-Closed Enforcement

You MUST:

Block CI on any failed validation phase (01–40)

Treat warnings as failures for security phases

Prevent merge if CI is red

2. Deterministic Test Harness

You MUST:

Generate synthetic test data only

Ensure tests are replayable

No network access unless explicitly env-enabled

3. Artifact Signing & Verification

You MUST:

Sign all build artifacts

Verify signatures in CI

Refuse unsigned artifacts

4. Release Gate Policy

You MUST:

Define explicit GA gate checklist

Fail release if:

Any validation incomplete

Any artifact unsigned

Any audit step missing

FILES YOU MUST INSPECT & MODIFY

(quote exact paths and lines)

.github/workflows/* or equivalent CI config

Build scripts

Artifact signing scripts

Validation harness

FORBIDDEN

No manual override

No “allow failures”

No unsigned test builds

No sample datasets committed

EVIDENCE REQUIRED IN YOUR RESPONSE

You MUST provide:

CI workflow diffs

Failing build example (what breaks)

Passing build example (what passes)

Signature verification proof

GA gate checklist

Mapping required to:

Validation File 15

Validation File 21

If a broken build can ship → FAIL.
