You are Cursor, acting as the implementation engineer for Phase 5.1 — LLM Generative Summarizer.

AUTHORITATIVE CONTEXT

explanation-assembly/ is NOT a summarizer.

You must build a new subsystem, not extend explanation-assembly.

LLM is NON-DECISIONAL, NON-ENFORCING, TEXT-ONLY.

This module is offline-first, deterministic, signed, and auditable.

OBJECTIVE

Design and implement an Offline LLM Summarizer that generates human-readable incident narratives from structured facts.

HARD CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

NO enforcement

NO decisions

NO raw packets

NO secrets

Deterministic prompts

Prompt hash must be logged

Output hash must be logged

PII redaction at generation time

Air-gapped capable

KillChain stages

SHAP explanations (numeric only)

Forensic artifacts metadata (NOT raw dumps)

Policy decisions (facts only)

Executive summary

Legal / Regulator narrative
(All generated separately, not post-processed)

REQUIRED DELIVERABLES (IN THIS ORDER)

Architecture write-up

New repo/module name

Clear separation from explanation-assembly

Prompt versioning & hashing model

PII redaction strategy

LLM execution sandbox

Output signing & audit logging

Failure modes (fail-closed)

EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN
