You are continuing RansomEye v1.0 – Enterprise & Military-Grade Build.

WORK UNIT: Enterprise Release Bundle & Final Validation

STRICT CONTEXT (DO NOT VIOLATE)

❌ NO code changes

❌ NO installer changes

❌ NO schema or contract changes

❌ NO new features

This task is packaging, validation, and release artifacts only.

OBJECTIVE (ONLY THIS)

Create the final enterprise release bundle for RansomEye v1.0 that:

Groups all installers cleanly

Provides a single authoritative entry point

Produces verifiable integrity artifacts

Enables customers to install components independently or together

REQUIRED OUTPUT STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)
/release/
  ransomeye-v1.0/
    core/
    linux-agent/
    windows-agent/
    dpi-probe/
    checksums/
      SHA256SUMS
      SHA256SUMS.sig
    audit/
      build-info.json
      component-manifest.json
    validate-release.sh
    README.md

REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
1. Installer Aggregation

Copy installers as-is into respective folders

Do NOT modify installer contents

2. Integrity & Audit Artifacts

Generate:

SHA256SUMS for every installer file

build-info.json:

version

build timestamp

OS used

git commit hashes

component-manifest.json:

component name

installer path

service name

standalone vs core

required privileges

3. Validation Script

validate-release.sh must:

Verify checksums

Verify required files exist

Fail fast on any mismatch

NOT install anything

4. README (CRITICAL)

README must clearly explain:

What RansomEye is

Components overview

Installation order (optional)

Standalone vs Core components

Credentials policy (gagan / gagan)

Supported OS matrix

Security & privilege model

How to validate integrity

How to get support (placeholder allowed)

PASS / FAIL CRITERIA

PASS only if:

Bundle is self-contained

Integrity verification works

No files modified from installers

Clear enterprise-grade documentation exists

FAIL if:

Any installer is changed

Any checksum missing

Validation script is non-deterministic

Begin immediately.
Do not explain.
Do not summarize.
Build the enterprise release bundle only.
