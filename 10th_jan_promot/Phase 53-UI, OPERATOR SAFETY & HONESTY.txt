Prompt Start

You are fixing PHASE 5 — UI, OPERATOR SAFETY & HONESTY for RansomEye.

This phase is SEQUENTIAL and depends on Phase 4 being PASS (now satisfied).

OBJECTIVE

Ensure operators are never misled.

After this phase:

The UI MUST NOT overstate certainty

Missing guarantees MUST be visible

Evidence quality MUST be explicit

No action can be taken on ambiguous intelligence without warning

MANDATORY FIXES (ALL REQUIRED)
1. Evidence Quality Indicators

UI MUST display:

Evidence completeness

Determinism status

Contradiction presence

AI provenance availability

No green checkmarks without proof.

2. Confidence vs Certainty Separation

You MUST:

Separate confidence score from confirmation state

Clearly label probabilistic vs deterministic conclusions

Prevent UI wording that implies certainty without CONFIRMED state

3. Operator Action Warnings

You MUST:

Warn operators when:

Evidence is partial

Contradictions exist

AI output is advisory only

Require explicit acknowledgment before action

4. API/UI Access Control

You MUST:

Enforce RBAC consistently

Prevent unauthorized visibility of sensitive actions

Ensure UI does not bypass policy authority

FILES YOU MUST INSPECT & MODIFY

(quote exact paths and lines)

ui/frontend/*

ui/backend/*

API response schemas

Operator action endpoints

FORBIDDEN

No optimistic wording

No hiding uncertainty

No default “OK” states

No auto-confirmation

EVIDENCE REQUIRED IN YOUR RESPONSE

You MUST provide:

UI state examples (before vs after)

Evidence quality model

Operator warning flows

RBAC enforcement proof

Mapping required to:

Validation File 14

Validation File 18

Validation File 19

If UI can mislead an operator → FAIL.
