Promot Start

You are continuing RansomEye — Enterprise & Military-Grade Platform Expansion.

This is PHASE B1 (MANDATORY).

No other work is allowed until this phase is complete, validated, and frozen.

WORK UNIT B1 — AI MODEL REGISTRY & GOVERNANCE CORE
ABSOLUTE CONTEXT (DO NOT VIOLATE)

❌ NO modification to v1.0 Core, Agents, DPI, Audit Ledger, or Global Validator

❌ NO AI inference logic inside this module

❌ NO model execution

❌ NO online dependencies

❌ NO implicit model loading

This phase builds governance only, not intelligence.

OBJECTIVE

Build a central AI Model Registry that provides full lifecycle governance for every AI/ML/LLM model used anywhere in RansomEye.

No model may:

Be loaded

Be executed

Be referenced
without registry approval.

MANDATORY CAPABILITIES
1. Model Registry (Core)

Versioned model records

Immutable model metadata

Cryptographic hash of model artifact

Model type (ML / DL / LLM / ruleset)

Intended use (classification, clustering, summarization, etc.)

Training data provenance (hash references, not raw data)

2. Lifecycle Management (NON-OPTIONAL)

Support explicit state transitions:

REGISTERED

PROMOTED

DEPRECATED

REVOKED

Rules:

No implicit promotion

No silent revocation

Every transition MUST be written to the Audit Ledger

3. Cryptographic Discipline

Encrypted model bundle ingestion

Signature verification before registry entry

Hash verification at every load attempt

Rejection on mismatch (fail-closed)

4. Hot-Swap Governance (CONTROL PLANE ONLY)

Registry allows marking a model as “active”

No runtime loading logic yet

Consumers will query registry later

5. Drift Detection Metadata (FOUNDATION ONLY)

Schema for drift metrics

Storage of drift observations

NO detection logic yet (future phase)

AUDIT & VALIDATION RULES

Every registry action MUST emit an Audit Ledger entry

Global Validator MUST be able to verify:

No unregistered models exist

No revoked model is active

Registry integrity matches ledger

PASS / FAIL CRITERIA

PASS only if:

No model can exist outside registry

Lifecycle transitions are explicit and auditable

Cryptographic checks are enforced

Registry is deterministic and offline-capable

FAIL if:

Models can be loaded without registry

Any lifecycle action is silent

Any state is mutable without audit

DELIVERABLE EXPECTATION

Produce full production-grade governance code, schemas, and documentation.

Do NOT summarize.
Do NOT explain verbally.
Build the AI Model Registry only.
