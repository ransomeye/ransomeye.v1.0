You are continuing RansomEye v1.0 – Clean-Room Rebuild.

PHASE: 8 — SOC UI (READ-ONLY)

PREVIOUS PHASES (FROZEN):

Phase 1: System Contracts

Phase 2: Database Schema

Phase 3: Installer Contracts

Phase 4: Minimal Data Plane

Phase 5: Correlation Engine

Phase 6: AI Core (Read-Only)

Phase 7: Policy Engine (Simulation-First)

HARD RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

❌ UI must NOT write to DB

❌ UI must NOT query base tables

❌ UI must NOT infer state

❌ UI must NOT trigger actions

❌ UI must NOT contain policy logic

❌ UI must NOT contain AI logic

❌ No schema changes

❌ No contract changes

UI is OBSERVATIONAL ONLY.

OBJECTIVE

Implement the minimal SOC UI that provides read-only visibility into system state.

REQUIRED DB VIEWS (MUST DEFINE)

Define READ-ONLY SQL VIEWS for:

v_active_incidents

incident_id

machine_id

stage

confidence

created_at

v_incident_timeline

incident_id

stage

transitioned_at

v_incident_evidence_summary

incident_id

evidence_count

v_policy_recommendations

incident_id

recommended_action

simulation_mode

created_at

v_ai_insights

incident_id

cluster_id

novelty_score

shap_summary

UI FEATURES (MINIMAL)
Dashboards

Incident list (from v_active_incidents)

Incident detail view:

Timeline

Evidence count

AI insights

Policy recommendations

Constraints

No edits

No buttons that execute actions

No “acknowledge”, “resolve”, or “close”

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
/services/
  ui/
    backend/
      main.py
      views.sql
      requirements.txt
    frontend/

README MUST EXPLICITLY STATE

UI is read-only

UI does not affect pipeline

UI reads from DB views only

System correctness is independent of UI

VALIDATION (PASS / FAIL)

PASS only if:

UI reads ONLY from views

UI cannot modify data

UI can be disabled without impact

No table writes exist

FAIL if:

Any DB write exists

Any base table is queried

Any action can be triggered

Begin immediately.
Do not explain — implement exactly.
