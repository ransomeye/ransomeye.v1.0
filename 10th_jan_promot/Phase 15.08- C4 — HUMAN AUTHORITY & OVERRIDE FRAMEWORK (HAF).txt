Promot Start

You are continuing RansomEye — Military-Grade Enterprise Security Platform.

This is PHASE C4 (MANDATORY, BLOCKING).

No enforcement, automation, playbooks, or advanced AI may be built until this phase is complete, validated, and frozen.

WORK UNIT C4 — HUMAN AUTHORITY & OVERRIDE FRAMEWORK (HAF)
ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS

❌ NO UI

❌ NO workflow engine

❌ NO assumptions about humans

❌ NO implicit trust

❌ NO free-text decisions

❌ NO shared keys with other subsystems

This subsystem records authority, it does not decide policy.

OBJECTIVE

Build a Human Authority Framework that provides:

Cryptographic proof of human decisions

Explicit override semantics

Role-based authority validation

Non-repudiation

Audit-ledger anchoring

Validator-verifiable accountability

REQUIRED STRUCTURE
/human-authority/
  schema/
    authority-action.schema.json
    role-assertion.schema.json
  crypto/
    human_key_manager.py
    signer.py
    verifier.py

    authority_validator.py
    override_processor.py
  api/

    sign_override.py

  README.md

REQUIRED ACTION TYPES (ENUM, FROZEN)

POLICY_OVERRIDE

INCIDENT_ESCALATION

INCIDENT_SUPPRESSION

PLAYBOOK_APPROVAL

PLAYBOOK_ABORT

RISK_ACCEPTANCE

FALSE_POSITIVE_DECLARATION

No others.

REQUIRED GUARANTEES

Every human action is:

Signed with a human-specific keypair

Bound to a role assertion

Bound to a scope (incident / policy / campaign)

Recorded in Audit Ledger

Overrides are explicit, never implicit

Overrides never erase automated decisions — they supersede them

Authority is validated before acceptance

No anonymous actions

No shared keys

No revocation ambiguity

CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODEL

Per-human keypair (ed25519 or RSA-PSS, choose and justify)

Separate trust root from:

Audit Ledger

Model Registry

System Explainer

Role assertion must be signed and verifiable

Override invalid if:

Role is insufficient

Signature invalid

Scope mismatch

Timestamp invalid

PASS / FAIL

PASS only if:

A human override can be proven, reconstructed, and verified

Responsibility is unambiguous

Overrides are replayable from ledger

Validator can verify authority chain end-to-end

FAIL if:

Any decision lacks a signer

Any override lacks role proof

Any action can be denied later

Any authority is implicit

OUTPUT EXPECTATION

Produce:

Production-grade code

Frozen schemas

Cryptographic enforcement

Audit ledger integration

Deterministic validation

Complete documentation

No placeholders.
No shortcuts.
Build the Human Authority Framework only.
