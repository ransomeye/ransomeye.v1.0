🔴 PROMPT 6 — JINJA2 PROMPT TEMPLATES (AUTHORITATIVE CONTENT)

Start Promot*

You are Cursor, acting as the implementation engineer for
Phase 5.4 — Authoritative Prompt Templates (Jinja2).

CONTEXT (FROZEN)

Prompt registry, assembler, hashing, and inference are COMPLETE.

This phase is content definition, not logic.

Templates are security-critical artifacts.

OBJECTIVE

Create the initial frozen prompt templates that control exactly what the LLM may say.

TEMPLATES TO CREATE (MANDATORY)

Create directory:

prompts/templates/


Create exactly these files:

soc_narrative_v1.0.0.jinja2

executive_summary_v1.0.0.jinja2

legal_narrative_v1.0.0.jinja2

No others.

HARD CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Templates MUST:

Use only structured inputs

Never speculate

Never introduce new facts

No adjectives implying certainty unless supported by evidence

Explicitly distinguish:

Observed facts

Correlated inferences

Policy decisions

No mitigation advice

No blame language

No probabilistic wording unless numeric confidence exists

Deterministic ordering of sections

REQUIRED STRUCTURE (ALL TEMPLATES)

Each template MUST include sections in this exact order:

Header

Scope & Source of Information

Incident Timeline (facts only)

Observed Behaviors

Correlated Findings

Policy & Response Actions (facts only)

Evidence References

Limitations & Assumptions

Closing Statement

AUDIENCE-SPECIFIC RULES
SOC Narrative

Technical

Precise

No simplification

No business language

Executive Summary

Non-technical

No timestamps unless necessary

Focus on impact and containment

Max 1 page equivalent

Legal / Regulator Narrative

Formal tone

No abbreviations

Explicit disclaimers

Chain-of-custody emphasis

Jurisdiction-neutral language

VERSIONING RULES

Version = v1.0.0

Templates are immutable

Any change requires new version

Do NOT register templates yet

DELIVERABLE

Respond with:

Full contents of all three template files

Explanation of how each section avoids hallucination

Explicit statement of what the templates will never say

End with:

“Phase 5.4 prompt templates defined. Ready for CLI tools.”
