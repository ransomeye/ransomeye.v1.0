PROMPT 6 — AGENT AUTONOMY (HEADLESS / FAIL-CLOSED MODE)

(FINAL GA GATE)

PROMPT START

You are working on RansomEye v1.0 GA – Audit Remediation Phase.
This is Phase F: Survivability & Autonomous Enforcement.

🔒 GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS (MANDATORY)

v1.0 GA hardening only

NO new features

NO new policy logic

NO relaxation of enforcement

Fail-closed is mandatory

Agent must never crash or fail open

TASK 6 — AGENT AUTONOMY WHEN CORE IS OFFLINE (GA BLOCKER)
Objective

Prove that endpoint agents remain secure, deterministic, and enforce policy even if the Core / C2 server is destroyed, unreachable, or under attack.

This is mandatory for:

Military deployments

Cyber-warfare survivability

Zero-trust enforcement

SCENARIO TO SIMULATE (MANDATORY TEST)

Agent starts normally and receives policy from Core

Core becomes unreachable (process killed / network severed)

A prohibited action is attempted on the endpoint

REQUIRED BEHAVIOR (STRICT)
1. Agent MUST NOT fail open

❌ Must NOT allow action because Core is unreachable

❌ Must NOT disable enforcement

❌ Must NOT crash

2. Agent MUST enforce last known good policy

Policy must be cached securely on disk

Cache must be integrity-checked at startup

Enforcement must continue without Core

3. If no policy exists

Agent must default to SAFE / DENY

Explicit log: “No policy available — default deny enforced”

HARD RULES

❌ No “allow all if disconnected”

❌ No silent degradation

❌ No best-effort mode

✅ Explicit autonomous enforcement

✅ Deterministic behavior

REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION
Agent Side

Secure policy cache (existing mechanism if present)

Startup logic:

If Core reachable → normal operation

If Core unreachable → load cached policy

Integrity check before applying cached policy

Validation Test (GA-Blocking)

Create a severed-link validation scenario:

Start Agent

Kill Core

Attempt mock prohibited action

Assert:

Action is blocked

Agent logs explicit autonomous enforcement

Agent remains running

DELIVERABLES

Agent logic changes (if any)

Policy cache handling explanation

Validation test steps

Example logs (offline enforcement)

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (FINAL GA GATE)

Agent enforces policy without Core

No fail-open paths

No crash

Behavior is deterministic and logged
