Promot Start*

You are continuing RansomEye v1.0 – Clean-Room Rebuild.

PHASE: 10 — SYSTEM HARDENING, SCALE READINESS & OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
STATUS: CONTINUOUS EXECUTION — DO NOT STOP UNTIL SYSTEM IS FULLY BUILT, TESTED, AND RUNNING WITH ZERO FAILURES

ABSOLUTE DIRECTIVE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This is military-grade, enterprise-class cybersecurity software intended for commercial sale.

Therefore:

❌ NO placeholders

❌ NO dummy files

❌ NO synthetic data

❌ NO test-only shortcuts

❌ NO “assume this exists”

❌ NO partial success

Everything must:

Build

Start

Run

Restart

Recover

Validate
without a single failure

Only after this is complete may installers be built.

PHASE 10 OBJECTIVE

Harden ALL EXISTING COMPONENTS so the system:

Runs continuously on this machine

Survives crashes, restarts, partial failures

Is operationally safe for customer environments

Is ready for installer packaging (Phase 11)

SCOPE — WHAT YOU MUST HARDEN (ALL REQUIRED)
Core Runtime Components (MANDATORY)

Ingest Service

Correlation Engine

AI Core

Policy Engine

SOC UI Backend

Linux Agent

DPI Probe (stubbed runtime, capture disabled for now)

Windows Agent is NOT implemented yet — do not invent it.

HARDENING DIMENSIONS (ALL REQUIRED)
1. PROCESS HARDENING

For every runtime component:

Deterministic startup

Fail-fast on misconfiguration

Clear exit codes

No silent crashes

Explicit logging (startup, shutdown, failure)

Deliver:

Startup checks

Fatal error classification

Graceful shutdown handlers

2. CONFIGURATION HARDENING

All configuration via:

Environment variables

Installer manifest

No fallback defaults for security-sensitive values

Missing config ⇒ hard failure

Deliver:

Centralized config loader per component

Explicit config validation errors

3. CRASH & RESTART SAFETY

Simulate and handle:

Process kill

Service restart

Partial component outage

System must:

Resume safely

Not duplicate data

Not corrupt state

4. DATA INTEGRITY HARDENING

Enforce hash-chain continuity checks

Enforce sequence monotonicity

Enforce idempotency across restarts

Detect and log corruption explicitly

No silent acceptance of bad state.

5. RESOURCE SAFETY

File descriptor safety

DB connection pooling limits

Backpressure behavior

Disk full detection (log + fail closed)

6. SCALE READINESS (SINGLE NODE)

You must validate:

Thousands of machines logically supported

High event cardinality handling

No unbounded memory growth

No unbounded disk growth

Simulation must use real agent behavior, not synthetic generators.

HARD RULES (REPEAT — DO NOT BREAK)

❌ No schema changes

❌ No contract changes

❌ No shortcuts

❌ No mock services

❌ No synthetic load generators

❌ No skipping failure cases

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)

You must modify and/or add files only under:

/services/
/agents/
/dpi/
/common/


NO changes under:

/contracts/
/schemas/
/installer/
/validation/

REQUIRED DELIVERABLES

Hardened startup & shutdown logic for each service

Explicit error classification & logging

Restart-safe behavior verified

End-to-end system running cleanly

Zero validation regressions (Phase 9 & 9.1 must still pass)

VALIDATION (PASS / FAIL)

PASS only if:

All services start cleanly

Linux Agent emits real events

Ingest, Correlation, AI, Policy, UI all run simultaneously

Validation harness passes unchanged

System survives restart with no duplication

No crashes, no warnings, no silent failures

FAIL if:

Any service crashes

Any undefined behavior exists

Any validation test fails

Any shortcut is taken

IMPORTANT NOTE

Do NOT build installers yet.
Installer generation happens only after Phase 10 is fully complete and frozen.

Begin immediately.
Do not explain.
Do not summarize.
Harden the system.
