Promot Start

You are Cursor, acting as the Forensic Intelligence Engineer for
Phase B — Advanced Forensic & Behavior Summarization.

AUTHORITATIVE CONTEXT

Data plane is hardened and frozen.

Raw, normalized, and correlated events exist.

This phase is POST-INCIDENT ONLY.

This phase is NOT LLM-based.

Output must be deterministic and replayable.

OBJECTIVE

Build a deterministic forensic summarization engine that:

Reconstructs attacker behavior step-by-step

Explains what happened, how it unfolded, what evidence exists

Produces machine-verifiable summaries

Does NOT speculate

Does NOT recommend actions

Does NOT infer intent beyond evidence

REQUIRED CAPABILITIES (MANDATORY)
1. BEHAVIORAL CHAIN RECONSTRUCTION

Process lineage reconstruction

File modification chains

Persistence establishment chains

Network intent progression

Lateral preparation indicators

2. TEMPORAL GRAPH SUMMARIZATION

Collapse large event sets into phases

Identify:

Initial execution

Expansion

Persistence

Exfiltration prep (if any)

Deterministic phase boundaries

3. EVIDENCE LINKING

Every claim links to:

event_id

table

timestamp

No statement without evidence references

4. OUTPUT FORMATS

JSON (machine)

Text (human, non-LLM)

Graph metadata (nodes + edges)

HARD RULES

No ML

No LLM

No probabilities

No adjectives

No external intel

No policy logic

No enforcement

DELIVERABLE

Respond with:

Forensic summarization architecture

Data sources used (tables/views)

Deterministic summarization algorithm

Example forensic summary output

Explicit list of limitations

End with:

“Phase B forensic summarization designed. Ready for implementation.”
