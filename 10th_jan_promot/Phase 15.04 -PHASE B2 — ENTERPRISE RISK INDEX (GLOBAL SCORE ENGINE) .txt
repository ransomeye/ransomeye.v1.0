Promot Start

You are continuing RansomEye — Enterprise & Military-Grade Platform Expansion.

This is PHASE B2 (MANDATORY).

No other work is allowed until this phase is fully complete, validated, and frozen.

WORK UNIT B2 — ENTERPRISE RISK INDEX ENGINE
ABSOLUTE CONTEXT (DO NOT VIOLATE)

❌ NO modification to v1.0 Core, Agents, DPI

❌ NO modification to Audit Ledger, Global Validator, AI Model Registry

❌ NO UI

❌ NO alerting

❌ NO enforcement

❌ NO heuristics without justification

This phase builds risk computation only.

OBJECTIVE

Build the Enterprise Risk Index, a deterministic engine that computes a global, normalized (0–100) risk score representing the security posture of the entire enterprise.

This score is:

The single executive truth

The input to board reporting

The baseline for automation thresholds

MANDATORY CAPABILITIES
1. Signal Ingestion (READ-ONLY)

Consume signals from:

Incidents (correlation engine)

AI metadata (novelty, clusters, drift markers)

Policy decisions

Threat correlation (future)

UBA (future)

No signal mutation allowed.

2. Risk Model (DETERMINISTIC)

Weighted aggregation

Explicit weight configuration

Temporal decay functions

Confidence-aware scoring

No randomness

3. Normalization

Output strictly in range 0–100

Defined severity bands (LOW / MODERATE / HIGH / CRITICAL)

Explainable component contributions

4. Audit & Assurance

Every score computation emits:

Audit Ledger entry

Global Validator must be able to:

Recompute score deterministically

Verify no missing signals

5. Historical Tracking

Maintain historical risk timeline

Immutable records

No retroactive mutation

PASS / FAIL CRITERIA

PASS only if:

Same inputs always produce same score

Score is explainable

Missing signals are detected

No mutation of source data

All computations are auditable

FAIL if:

Any randomness exists

Any silent assumptions exist

Score cannot be recomputed by Global Validator

DELIVERABLE EXPECTATION

Produce full production-grade code, schemas, and documentation.

Do NOT summarize.
Do NOT explain verbally.
Build the Enterprise Risk Index only.
