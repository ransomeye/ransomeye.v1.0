Promot Start

You are Cursor, acting as the Validation & GA Readiness Engineer for
Phase C — Global GA Validation & Determinism Proof.

AUTHORITATIVE CONTEXT

All core modules are implemented.

Data plane is hardened and frozen.

Phase A (Detection), Phase B (Forensics) are complete.

System must be GA-ready, auditable, and replay-verifiable.

OBJECTIVE

Prove that RansomEye is GA-ready by executing end-to-end validation with:

Determinism guarantees

Replay validation

Failure injection

Scale simulation

Audit proof

MANDATORY VALIDATION AREAS
1. DETERMINISM PROOF

Same input → same output

Across:

Detection

Correlation

Forensics

Summaries

Hash comparison required

2. REPLAY VALIDATION

Replay raw_events

Rebuild normalized events

Rebuild incidents

Rebuild forensic summaries

Verify identical hashes

3. FAILURE INJECTION

Simulate:

DB restarts

Queue overflow

Agent disconnects

Duplicate events

Partial writes

Verify:

No corruption

No silent loss

Correct degradation

4. SCALE VALIDATION

Simulate:

1M+ events

Burst ingestion

Sustained load

POC single-host mode

Measure:

Latency

Backpressure

CPU/memory

DB stability

5. AUDIT & COMPLIANCE ARTIFACTS

Produce:

Determinism proof logs

Replay verification logs

Failure reports

GA readiness checklist

Signed validation report (PDF/JSON)

HARD RULES

No mocks

No assumptions

No “expected” language

Evidence only

DELIVERABLE

Respond with:

Validation architecture

Test matrix

Evidence artifacts

GA readiness verdict

Explicit list of residual risks (if any)

End with:

“Phase C validation complete. RansomEye is GA-ready.”
