Promot Start

You are Cursor, acting as the Validation & Assurance Engineer for
Phase C — Global GA Validation & Determinism Proof.

AUTHORITATIVE CONTEXT

Core Engine, DPI Probe, Linux Agent, Windows Agent are implemented.

Phase B forensic summarization is implemented and corrected.

Data plane is hardened and frozen.

This phase determines GA eligibility.

OBJECTIVE

Prove that RansomEye is GA-ready by validating:

Determinism

Replayability

Data integrity

Safety under load

No hidden failure paths

MANDATORY VALIDATION TRACKS (ALL REQUIRED)
TRACK 1 — DETERMINISM PROOF

Same inputs → same outputs across:

Detection

Correlation

Forensics

Summarization

Hash comparison required

Multiple runs required

TRACK 2 — REPLAY & REHYDRATION

Rebuild:

Incidents

Killchains

Forensic summaries

From raw_events only

No divergence allowed

TRACK 3 — FAILURE INJECTION

Inject:

DB connection loss

Agent disconnect

Queue overflow

Duplicate events

Partial writes

Verify:

No corruption

No silent loss

Correct degradation

TRACK 4 — SCALE & STRESS

≥1,000,000 event ingestion burst

Mixed ETW + DPI + Agent traffic

Co-located deployment

Verify:

No deadlocks

No unbounded latency

No data loss

TRACK 5 — SECURITY & SAFETY

Verify:

No enforcement without authority

No unsigned execution

No cross-module DB access

No direct table reads

RBAC enforcement

DELIVERABLE

Respond with:

Validation plan

Test scenarios

Metrics collected

Pass / Fail criteria

Explicit GA verdict

End with:

“Phase C validation complete. GA decision ready.”
