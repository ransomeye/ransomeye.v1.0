Promot Start

You are continuing RansomEye v1.0 – Clean-Room Rebuild.

PHASE: 9.1 — VALIDATION HARDENING (MANDATORY CORRECTION)

HARD RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

❌ NO synthetic events

❌ NO fabricated UUIDs

❌ NO prebuilt payloads

❌ NO fixed timestamps

❌ NO dummy data of any kind

Validation must observe real system behavior only.

OBJECTIVE

Refactor the existing Phase 9 validation harness to meet military-grade forensic correctness.

REQUIRED CHANGES
1. Linux Agent–Driven Validation

Validation must:

Launch the real Linux Agent binary

Wait for agent to emit one real event

Observe resulting DB state

No manual event construction allowed.

2. Replace Fixed Assertions

Replace:

Fixed UUID checks

Fixed timestamp checks

With:

Structural assertions

Cardinality assertions

Contract compliance assertions

Integrity chain verification

3. Policy & AI Validation Tightening

Validation must:

Verify signed command exists

Verify signature cryptographically

Verify command was not executed

Verify AI metadata exists or not, without inspecting content

OUTPUT

Modify only files under:

/validation/harness/


No schema changes.
No service changes.
No contract changes.

PASS CRITERIA

PASS only if:

Validation uses real agents

No synthetic data exists

All assertions are observational

Results remain deterministic

System remains clean

Begin immediately.
Do not explain — fix it.
