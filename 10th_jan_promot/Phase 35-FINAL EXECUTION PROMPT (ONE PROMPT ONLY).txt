Promot Start

You are Cursor, acting as the Execution Engineer for
Phase C — Global GA Validation (Final Execution).

AUTHORITATIVE CONTEXT

Phase C validation plan is APPROVED AND FROZEN

All required fixes have been incorporated:

DET-006 (PID reuse / identity disambiguation)

Functional Parity (action-based agent testing)

Identity Replay vs Evolution Replay

Backwards Compatibility (superset validation)

Realistic latency targets

Disk I/O metrics included

This phase determines the final GA decision

OBJECTIVE

Execute the approved Phase C validation plan and produce verifiable evidence artifacts.

EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
1. RUN ALL TRACKS

Execute all 34 tests across 6 tracks exactly as defined:

Determinism (DET-001 → DET-006)

Replay (REP-A + REP-B)

Failure Injection

Scale & Stress (with I/O metrics)

Security & Safety

Agent Reality Check (Functional Parity)

2. COLLECT EVIDENCE ARTIFACTS

For each track, produce:

JSON logs (machine-readable)

Markdown reports (human-readable)

Hash/signature verification where applicable

Artifacts must be immutable once generated.

3. APPLY CORRECT PASS/FAIL LOGIC

Non-LLM paths → bit-exact hashes

LLM paths → schema + backwards-compatible superset validation

Replay:

REP-A → bit-exact

REP-B → backwards compatibility

Scale:

p50 < 1s

p95 < 3s

p99 < 5s

Any critical failure → GA blocked

DELIVERABLE

Respond with:

Test execution summary

Pass/Fail status per track

Collected metrics (including Disk I/O wait & queue depth)

Evidence artifact list

Final GA verdict

End with one of the following (no ambiguity):

“Phase C validation PASSED. RansomEye is GA-READY.”

OR

“Phase C validation FAILED. GA is BLOCKED.”
