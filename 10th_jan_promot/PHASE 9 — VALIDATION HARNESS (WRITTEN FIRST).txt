Promot Start

You are continuing RansomEye v1.0 – Clean-Room Rebuild.

PHASE: 9 — VALIDATION HARNESS (WRITTEN FIRST)

PREVIOUS PHASES (FROZEN):

Phase 1: System Contracts

Phase 2: Database Schema

Phase 3: Installer Contracts

Phase 4: Minimal Data Plane

Phase 5: Correlation Engine

Phase 6: AI Core (Read-Only)

Phase 7: Policy Engine (Simulation-First)

Phase 8: SOC UI (Read-Only)

HARD RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

❌ No service logic

❌ No mocks of core logic

❌ No sleeps / timing hacks

❌ No randomness

❌ No skipping failures

❌ No schema changes

❌ No contract changes

Validation must assert real system behavior.

OBJECTIVE

Implement the authoritative validation harness that proves end-to-end correctness of RansomEye v1.0.

VALIDATION CASES (ALL REQUIRED)

Implement tests for:

Cold start correctness

Zero-event correctness

One-event correctness

Duplicate event handling

Failure semantics enforcement

Subsystem disablement (AI, Policy, UI)

Each test must:

Set up environment

Execute scenario

Assert DB state

Assert logs / exit codes

Clean up

README MUST EXPLICITLY STATE

What is validated

Why failures block release

How to run validation

Determinism guarantees

PASS / FAIL CRITERIA

PASS only if:

All tests pass consistently

Results are deterministic

System is left clean

No silent failures exist

FAIL if:

Any nondeterminism

Any skipped test

Any silent error

Begin immediately.
