Promot Start

You are continuing RansomEye — Military-Grade Enterprise Security Platform.

This is PHASE C3 (MANDATORY, BLOCKING).

No other subsystem may be built until this phase is complete, validated, and frozen.

WORK UNIT C3 — SYSTEM EXPLANATION ENGINE (SEE)
ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS

❌ NO modification to existing subsystems

❌ NO ML inference

❌ NO heuristics

❌ NO UI

❌ NO free-text generation

❌ NO assumptions

This subsystem reconstructs reasoning, it does not invent it.

OBJECTIVE

Build a System Explanation Engine that produces end-to-end, signed, validator-verifiable explanation bundles explaining why the system acted.

REQUIRED INPUT SOURCES (READ-ONLY)

Audit Ledger (root of truth)

KillChain & Forensics

Threat Correlation Graph

Risk Index Engine

Policy Engine decisions

(Later) Human Override records

REQUIRED OUTPUT
Signed Explanation Bundle

Explains:

Why an incident existed

Why a KillChain stage advanced

Why campaign inference occurred

Why risk score changed

Why policy recommendation escalated

Whether a human overrode it (if applicable)

NON-NEGOTIABLE GUARANTEES

Deterministic

Fully reconstructable from ledger

Signed with dedicated keypair

Validator-verifiable

Immutable bundles

Zero ambiguity

PASS / FAIL

PASS only if:

Same inputs → same explanation

Explanation can be rebuilt from scratch

Validator verifies reasoning chain

No missing causal links

FAIL if:

Any step is implicit

Any reasoning is inferred without evidence

Any explanation cannot be cryptographically verified

OUTPUT EXPECTATION

Produce:

Full production code

Frozen schemas

Cryptographic signing

Documentation

No summaries.
No shortcuts.
Build the System Explanation Engine only.
