You are continuing RansomEye v1.0 – Enterprise & Military-Grade Build.

WORK UNIT: Installer Packaging — RansomEye Core

STRICT CONTEXT (DO NOT VIOLATE)

Core code is frozen

Validation is frozen

❌ No code changes unless installer uncovers a fatal issue

❌ No schema changes

❌ No contract changes

❌ No feature additions

This step is packaging only.

OBJECTIVE (ONLY THIS)

Create a commercial-grade installer for RansomEye Core that:

Installs cleanly on Ubuntu LTS

Uses any install path chosen by the user

Runs Core as a single unified service

Uses credentials:

user: gagan

password: gagan

Is deterministic, idempotent, and fail-closed

INSTALLER REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
1. Installer Type

Bash installer (install.sh)

Must be executable

Must fail fast on any error

2. User & Permissions

Installer must:

Create system user: ransomeye

Set ownership and permissions correctly

Drop privileges for runtime

3. Paths (NO HARDCODED PATHS)

Installer must:

Prompt for install root (example: /opt/ransomeye)

Create:

bin/

lib/

config/

logs/

runtime/

Write installation manifest with absolute paths

4. Configuration

Installer must generate:

Environment file for Core

DB connection config using:

user: gagan

password: gagan

Log directories with correct permissions

5. Service Management

Create ONE systemd service:

ransomeye-core.service

No per-module services

Service must:

Start Core

Restart on failure

Stop cleanly

6. Validation Hook

Installer must:

Start Core

Perform health check

Fail installation if Core does not start cleanly

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
/installer/
  core/
    install.sh
    uninstall.sh
    ransomeye-core.service
    installer.manifest.json
    README.md

README MUST EXPLICITLY STATE

What the installer does

Supported OS

How to install

How to uninstall

Failure behavior (fail-closed)

No assumptions about paths

PASS / FAIL CRITERIA

PASS only if:

Installer works on a clean Ubuntu system

Installation path is user-defined

Core starts successfully

Core stops cleanly

Re-running installer is idempotent

FAIL if:

Any hardcoded path exists

Multiple services are created

Installer continues after failure

Begin immediately.
Do not explain.
Do not summarize.
Build the Core installer only.
