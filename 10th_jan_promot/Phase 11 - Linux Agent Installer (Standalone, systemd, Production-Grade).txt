WORK UNIT: Linux Agent Installer (Standalone, systemd)

STRICT CONTEXT (DO NOT VIOLATE)

Linux Agent is a standalone component

❌ Do NOT modify Linux Agent code

❌ Do NOT modify Core code

❌ Do NOT assume Core is installed

❌ Do NOT hardcode any paths

❌ Do NOT add features

This task is installer packaging only.

OBJECTIVE (ONLY THIS)

Create a production-grade installer for the Linux Agent that:

Installs cleanly on Ubuntu LTS

Uses any install path chosen by the user

Runs as a standalone systemd service

Emits real events when Core is present

Fails cleanly when Core is absent (no crashes, no loops)

INSTALLER REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
1. Installer Type

Bash installer (install.sh)

Executable

Fail-fast (set -euo pipefail)

2. User & Permissions

Installer must:

Create system user: ransomeye-agent

Drop privileges for runtime

Ensure least-privilege filesystem access

3. Paths (NO HARDCODED PATHS)

Installer must:

Prompt for install root (example: /opt/ransomeye-agent)

Create:

bin/

config/

logs/

runtime/

Write agent installation manifest with absolute paths

4. Configuration

Installer must generate:

Agent environment file

Core endpoint configurable via env (no assumption Core exists)

Credentials fixed:

username: gagan

password: gagan

5. systemd Service (MANDATORY)

Create ONE service:

ransomeye-linux-agent.service

Service must:

Run Linux Agent binary

Restart on failure

Handle SIGTERM cleanly

Not crash-loop if Core is unreachable

6. Validation Hook

Installer must:

Start agent

Verify process is running

NOT require Core to be present

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
/installer/
  linux-agent/
    install.sh
    uninstall.sh
    ransomeye-linux-agent.service
    installer.manifest.json
    README.md

README MUST EXPLICITLY STATE

Standalone nature of Linux Agent

Supported OS

How to install

How to uninstall

Behavior when Core is unreachable

No path assumptions

PASS / FAIL CRITERIA

PASS only if:

Agent installs without Core

Agent runs under systemd

Agent stops cleanly

Re-running installer is idempotent

Uninstall removes all artifacts

FAIL if:

Any hardcoded path exists

Agent assumes Core availability

Multiple services are created

Begin immediately.
Do not explain.
Do not summarize.
Build the Linux Agent installer only.
