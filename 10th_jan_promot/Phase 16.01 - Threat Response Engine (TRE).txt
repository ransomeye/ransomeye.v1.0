Implement the Threat Response Engine (TRE) for RansomEye with the following STRICT constraints:

1. TRE is execution-only, not decision-making
2. TRE executes ONLY final Policy Engine decisions
3. TRE enforces Human Authority (HAF) where required
4. All actions are signed (ed25519), auditable, and rollback-capable
5. Agents validate and execute commands but never decide
6. Rollback is mandatory and first-class
7. All records are immutable and audit-anchored
8. No placeholders, no dummy data, no heuristics, no ML

Deliverables:
- Full directory structure
- Frozen schemas (zero optional fields)
- Action validation engine
- Secure command signing and verification
- Agent command dispatch protocol
- Rollback manager
- Audit ledger integration
- DB schema additions
- CLI tools for execution and rollback
- README with legal and regulatory positioning

The design must align with:
- Policy Engine
- Human Authority Framework (HAF)
- System Explanation Engine (SEE)
- Audit Ledger
- Existing Linux/Windows agents
