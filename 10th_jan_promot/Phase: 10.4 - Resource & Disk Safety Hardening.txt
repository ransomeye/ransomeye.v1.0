WORK UNIT: Resource & Disk Safety Hardening

STRICT CONTEXT (DO NOT VIOLATE)

Applies to RansomEye Core runtime

Core runs as one unified process

❌ No schema changes

❌ No contract changes

❌ No retries

❌ No background schedulers

❌ No new features

This is safety hardening only.

OBJECTIVE (ONLY THIS)

Harden Core against resource exhaustion and disk failures so the system fails explicitly and safely, never silently.

COMPONENTS IN SCOPE (CORE)

Ingest

Correlation Engine

AI Core

Policy Engine

UI Backend

REQUIRED HARDENING (IMPLEMENT ALL)
1. Disk Safety (MANDATORY)

Implement explicit checks and fail-fast behavior for:

Disk full conditions

Permission denied (logs, temp, runtime dirs)

Read-only filesystem

Rules:

Detect error at write attempt

Log explicit error

Terminate Core immediately

No retries, no degradation

2. Log Safety

Prevent unbounded log growth

Enforce size limits or rotation without losing critical errors

If logging fails → terminate Core (fail-fast)

No silent logging failures.

3. File Descriptor & Resource Limits

Detect exhaustion of file descriptors

Detect inability to open files/sockets

Fail fast with explicit error

4. Memory Safety (BASIC, NOT OPTIMIZATION)

Detect MemoryError / allocation failures

Abort Core immediately on memory allocation failure

No swap-based survival logic

OUTPUT CONSTRAINTS

Modify existing code paths only

Use explicit exception handling

No new abstractions unless strictly required for safety

No platform-specific hacks

Each modified component must update its README with a section:

Resource & Disk Safety Guarantees
PASS CRITERIA

PASS only if:

Disk full causes explicit termination

Logging failure causes explicit termination

Resource exhaustion causes explicit termination

No silent degradation paths exist

Behavior is deterministic under resource failure

Begin immediately.
Do not explain.
Do not refactor unrelated code.
Harden resource and disk safety only.
