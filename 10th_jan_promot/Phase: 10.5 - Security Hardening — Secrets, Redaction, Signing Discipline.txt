You are continuing RansomEye v1.0 – Enterprise & Military-Grade Build.

WORK UNIT: Security Hardening (Secrets, Redaction, Signing Discipline)

STRICT CONTEXT (DO NOT VIOLATE)

Applies to RansomEye Core runtime

Core runs as one unified process

❌ No schema changes

❌ No contract changes

❌ No new features

❌ No retries

❌ No background schedulers

❌ No standalone services added

Security hygiene only.

OBJECTIVE (ONLY THIS)

Eliminate secret leakage risks and enforce cryptographic discipline across Core.

COMPONENTS IN SCOPE (CORE)

Ingest

Correlation Engine

AI Core

Policy Engine

UI Backend

Common logging & config utilities

REQUIRED HARDENING (IMPLEMENT ALL)
1. Secrets Handling (MANDATORY)

All secrets only from environment variables

No secrets in:

Code

Config files

Logs

Exceptions

Validate presence and format at startup

If a required secret is missing or malformed → terminate Core immediately

2. Log Redaction (MANDATORY)

Implement centralized redaction for:

DB credentials

API tokens

Signing keys

Any value matching secret patterns

Ensure:

Secrets never appear in logs

Stack traces are sanitized

Any attempt to log a secret → terminate Core

3. Signing Discipline (Policy Engine)

Ensure command signing keys:

Are read once at startup

Never logged

Never reloaded dynamically

Validate key strength and format

Fail fast on weak/invalid keys

4. Untrusted Input Handling (AI & UI)

Treat AI metadata and UI inputs as untrusted

Validate types and bounds before processing

Abort Core on malformed or unexpected structures

OUTPUT CONSTRAINTS

Modify existing code paths only

No new crypto schemes

Use existing libraries already in use

No platform-specific hacks

Each modified component must update its README with:

Security & Secrets Handling Guarantees
PASS CRITERIA

PASS only if:

No secrets can be logged

Missing/weak secrets terminate Core

Signing keys are handled once, securely

Malformed untrusted input terminates Core

Behavior is deterministic and explicit

Begin immediately.
Do not explain.
Do not refactor unrelated code.
Harden security hygiene only.
