****Promot Start****

Implement **Branding, Visual Identity & Evidence Marking Hardening** across RansomEye (NON-OPTIONAL, FINAL-STAGE HARDENING).

This is **not cosmetic**. This is **forensic identity, legal clarity, and chain-of-custody marking**.

---

## Objective

Ensure **RansomEye identity is cryptographically, visually, and evidentially bound** across:

* UI
* Reports
* Exports
* Evidence artifacts
* Human-facing outputs

While **never affecting logic, truth, or authority**.

Logo path (authoritative, do not relocate):

```
/home/ransomeye/rebuild/logo.png
```

---

## 1. Rules (ABSOLUTE)

* ❌ Logo must **never** affect:

  * Hashes
  * Signatures
  * Evidence integrity
  * Explanation meaning
* ❌ Logo must **never** be embedded inside:

  * Signed payload hashes
  * Canonical JSON
  * Evidence blobs
* ✅ Logo is **presentation-only**, rendered **after integrity is sealed**

---

## 2. Signed Reporting Engine — Branding Integration (MANDATORY)

### Apply to:

* PDF
* HTML
* CSV (header only, textual)

### Requirements

* Logo rendered in **header/footer layer only**
* Outside signed content hash boundary
* Visual watermark style for PDF:

  * Top-left: Logo
  * Bottom-right: “RansomEye — Evidence Report”
* HTML:

  * `<header>` block only
* CSV:

  * Comment header line only (e.g. `# Generated by RansomEye`)

### Explicit rule

> Signed hash must NOT change if logo file is replaced.

Add automated test proving this.

---

## 3. UI Backend (Core UI) — Identity Marking

### Required changes

* Global header:

  * Logo
  * Product name: **RansomEye**
  * Version (from build-info.json)
* Footer:

  * “Evidence-grade system — Deterministic — Verifiable”
* UI must:

  * Read logo path from environment variable:

    ```
    RANSOMEYE_LOGO_PATH
    ```
  * Default to `/home/ransomeye/rebuild/logo.png`
  * Fail-open visually if logo missing (NO crash)

❌ Never hardcode paths.

---

## 4. Evidence & Export Marking (Forensics / KillChain / Reports)

All human-facing exports must include:

* Visual identity (logo)
* Evidence notice:

  > “This artifact is evidence-grade and cryptographically verifiable.”

But:

* **Never inside evidence hash**
* **Never inside canonical data**

---

## 5. Supply-Chain & Installer Branding Check

Installers must:

* Display RansomEye name and logo **before install**
* Display:

  * Artifact ID
  * SHA256
  * Signature status (PASS/FAIL)

This is **operator assurance**, not trust enforcement.

---

## 6. Documentation Update (MANDATORY)

Add section to:

* Signed Reporting README
* Supply Chain README
* Global Validator README

Title:
**Branding vs Integrity Boundary**

Must explain:

* Why branding is excluded from cryptographic scope
* Why visual identity still matters legally
* Court / regulator interpretation

Include statement verbatim:

> “Branding asserts origin; cryptography asserts integrity. RansomEye separates both by design.”

---

## 7. Validation Criteria (RELEASE-BLOCKING)

You are done only if:

* Logo is visible in UI and reports
* Hashes do NOT change if logo changes
* Environment-driven logo path
* No hardcoded paths
* No logic contamination
* Tests prove separation
* Documentation updated

---

## 8. Forbidden

❌ No embedding logo bytes into hashes
❌ No watermarking inside signed content
❌ No hardcoded file paths
❌ No UI crashes on missing logo
❌ No changing report signatures

---

## Final Principle

> **Identity must be visible. Integrity must be provable. Authority must remain separate.**

Implement accordingly.
