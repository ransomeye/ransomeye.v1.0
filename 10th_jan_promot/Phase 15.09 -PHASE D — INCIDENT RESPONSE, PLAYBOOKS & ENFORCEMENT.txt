Promot Start

You are continuing RansomEye — Military-Grade Enterprise Security Platform.

This is PHASE D (MANDATORY).

This phase builds Incident Response, Playbooks, and Enforcement, but:

❌ No implicit execution

❌ No silent automation

❌ No unsigned actions

❌ No authority bypass

Every enforcement must be:

Explained (SEE)

Authorized (HAF)

Audited (Audit Ledger)

Verifiable (Global Validator)

WORK UNIT D1 — INCIDENT RESPONSE & PLAYBOOK ENGINE
ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS

Playbooks are data, not code

No shell execution

No arbitrary scripts

No runtime mutation

No background autonomy

Execution is deterministic, sandboxed, and replayable.

isolate_host

block_ip

disable_account

snapshot_memory

snapshot_disk

notify_human

No loops

No branching

No conditionals

No variables

No scripting

EXECUTION RULES

Execution requires:

Valid playbook signature

Valid authority action (HAF)

Matching scope

Explanation bundle reference

Execution emits:

Execution record

Audit ledger entry

Rollback must be:

Explicit

Signed

Logged

Sandbox enforcement:

No system calls

No network access

No privilege escalation

PASS / FAIL

PASS only if:

Playbooks are immutable

Execution is reproducible

Authority is mandatory

Rollback is provable

Validator can replay everything

FAIL if:

Any execution is unsigned

Any action is implicit

Any authority is assumed

Any step is opaque

OUTPUT EXPECTATION

Production-grade engine

Frozen schemas

Cryptographic enforcement

Audit ledger integration

Validator compatibility

Complete documentation

No placeholders.
No shortcuts.
