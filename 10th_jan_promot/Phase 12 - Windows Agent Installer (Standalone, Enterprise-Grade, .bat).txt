WORK UNIT: Windows Agent Installer (Standalone, .bat)

STRICT CONTEXT (DO NOT VIOLATE)

Windows Agent is a standalone component

❌ Do NOT modify Windows Agent code

❌ Do NOT modify Core code

❌ Do NOT assume Core is installed

❌ Do NOT hardcode any paths

❌ Do NOT introduce MSI / PowerShell (BAT ONLY)

This task is installer packaging only.

OBJECTIVE (ONLY THIS)

Create a production-grade Windows installer for the Windows Agent that:

Installs cleanly on Windows Server / Windows 10+

Uses any install path chosen by the user

Runs as a Windows Service

Emits telemetry when Core is reachable

Fails gracefully when Core is unreachable (no crash loops)

INSTALLER REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
1. Installer Type

Windows batch installer (install.bat)

Must be run as Administrator

Fail-fast on any error

2. User & Permissions

Installer must:

Create Windows service user: ransomeye-agent

Run service under least privilege

Ensure filesystem permissions are minimal

3. Paths (NO HARDCODED PATHS)

Installer must:

Prompt for install directory (example: C:\RansomEye\Agent)

Create:

bin\

config\

logs\

runtime\

Generate installation manifest with absolute paths

4. Configuration

Installer must generate:

Environment/config file

Core endpoint configurable

Credentials fixed:

username: gagan

password: gagan

5. Windows Service (MANDATORY)

Create ONE service:

RansomEyeWindowsAgent

Service must:

Run agent executable

Auto-restart on failure

Stop cleanly

NOT crash-loop if Core is unreachable

6. Validation Hook

Installer must:

Start service

Verify service is running

NOT require Core to be reachable

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
/installer/
  windows-agent/
    install.bat
    uninstall.bat
    ransomeye-windows-agent.service.txt
    installer.manifest.json
    README.md

README MUST EXPLICITLY STATE

Standalone nature of Windows Agent

Supported Windows versions

How to install (Administrator required)

How to uninstall

Behavior when Core is unreachable

No path assumptions

PASS / FAIL CRITERIA

PASS only if:

Agent installs without Core

Windows service starts

Service stops cleanly

Re-running installer is idempotent

Uninstall removes all artifacts

FAIL if:

Any hardcoded path exists

PowerShell/MSI is used

Agent assumes Core availability

Multiple services are created

Begin immediately.
Do not explain.
Do not summarize.
Build the Windows Agent installer only.
