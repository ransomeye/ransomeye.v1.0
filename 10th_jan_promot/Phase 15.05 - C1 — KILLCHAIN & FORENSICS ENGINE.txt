Promot Start

You are continuing RansomEye — Enterprise & Military-Grade Platform Expansion.

This is PHASE C1 (MANDATORY).

No other work is allowed until this phase is fully complete, validated, and frozen.

WORK UNIT C1 — KILLCHAIN & FORENSICS ENGINE
ABSOLUTE CONTEXT (DO NOT VIOLATE)

❌ NO modification to v1.0 Core, Agents, DPI

❌ NO modification to Audit Ledger, Global Validator, Model Registry, Risk Index

❌ NO UI

❌ NO automation

❌ NO alerts

❌ NO heuristics without justification

This phase builds evidence-grade correlation only.

OBJECTIVE

Build the KillChain & Forensics Engine that reconstructs full adversary timelines across hosts, users, processes, and network activity — with court-admissible evidence handling.

MANDATORY CAPABILITIES
1. MITRE ATT&CK Timeline Reconstruction

Map events to MITRE techniques

Explicit stage transitions

Ordered, immutable timeline

Cross-host stitching

2. Evidence Management (NON-OPTIONAL)

Memory dump references (not blobs)

Disk artifact references

Artifact hashing

Compression support

Secure storage indexing

3. Campaign Correlation

Link incidents across:

Hosts

Users

IPs

Malware families

Deterministic linking rules

4. Chain-of-Custody Integration

Every evidence access logged to Audit Ledger

No silent reads

Evidence integrity verification

5. Assurance Compatibility

Global Validator must be able to:

Verify timelines

Verify evidence hashes

Detect missing stages

PASS / FAIL CRITERIA

PASS only if:

Timelines are immutable

Cross-host correlation is deterministic

Evidence hashes verify

Chain-of-custody is complete

No evidence access is unlogged

FAIL if:

Any timeline can be mutated

Evidence integrity is assumed

MITRE mapping is ambiguous

Validator cannot replay results

DELIVERABLE EXPECTATION

Produce full production-grade code, schemas, and documentation.

Do NOT summarize.
Do NOT explain verbally.
Build the KillChain & Forensics Engine only.
