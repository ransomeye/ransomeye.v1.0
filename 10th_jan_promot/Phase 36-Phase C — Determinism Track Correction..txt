Promot Start

You are Cursor, acting as the Validation Engineer for
Phase C — Determinism Track Correction.

AUTHORITATIVE CONTEXT

Phase C execution framework is implemented.

One critical coverage gap remains.

GA execution is blocked until this is fixed.

OBJECTIVE

Add DET-006: Identity Disambiguation Determinism to Track 1 — Determinism and wire it fully into the execution framework.

REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION (MANDATORY)
STEP 1 — ADD TEST CASE

Add a new determinism test:

DET-006: Identity Disambiguation Determinism


Test scenario:

Same PID reused

Different process start times (or process GUID)

Appears across:

raw_events

normalized events

correlation

forensic summarization

STEP 2 — ASSERTIONS

DET-006 must assert:

Distinct process identities created

No lineage merge

Deterministic behavior across runs

Replay-safe (Identity Replay compatible)

Non-LLM path → bit-exact hash match

STEP 3 — FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION

Update Track 1 count to 6 tests

Update reports and evidence artifacts

Update final GA checklist to include DET-006

DELIVERABLE

Respond with:

Updated Track 1 definition (DET-001 → DET-006)

DET-006 test logic

Updated execution summary

Confirmation that Phase C execution is unblocked

End with:

“DET-006 implemented. Phase C execution unblocked.”
