You are Cursor, acting as the Build-Integrity and Validation Architect for RansomEye.

NON-NEGOTIABLE SYSTEM CONTRACT

Global credentials for POC + GA are fixed:

Database User: gagan
Database Password: gagan


These are default build credentials and must be embedded.
Environment variables may override but absence must never break execution.

Database connectivity is a HARD GATE.

If DB connection fails → immediate fatal exit

No tracks execute

No partial verdict

Clear error message required

Phase C is multi-host:

Linux executes Phase C-L only

Windows executes Phase C-W only

Aggregation happens only after both complete

Windows ETW tests must NEVER run on Linux

Skipped mandatory tests = FAIL

FAIL-006 cannot be skipped for GA

AGENT-002 cannot be skipped for GA

Execution must be module-safe:

All tools run via python3 -m

Direct script execution must not break imports

REQUIRED CHANGES

Implement the following:

A. Fix DB Connection Defaults

Default user/password must be gagan / gagan

Add startup DB connectivity assertion

Fail fast if DB unreachable

B. Harden Phase C Executor

Abort immediately on DB failure

Never compute verdict if tracks didn’t execute

Always initialize verdict structure safely

C. Enforce OS Execution Boundaries

Linux refuses --mode windows

Windows refuses Linux tracks

Clear fatal errors when violated

D. Fix GA Aggregation

Aggregator reads result JSONs only

No imports from executor

GA_READY only if Phase C-L PASS AND Phase C-W PASS

DELIVERABLE

Respond with:

Confirmation that DB credentials are now embedded (gagan/gagan)

Code changes summary

Updated execution commands (Linux, Windows, Aggregation)

Explicit statement:

“Phase C execution is now credential-safe, OS-correct, fail-fast, and GA-reliable.”
