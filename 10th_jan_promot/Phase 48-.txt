Prompt Start

You are fixing PHASE 0 — INSTALLER & BOOTSTRAP TRUST for RansomEye.

Scope (STRICT)

You may ONLY modify:

Installer scripts

Bootstrap validation logic

Core startup validation

You may NOT:

Add features

Change architecture

Touch runtime logic beyond trust validation

Objective

Ensure it is impossible to install or start RansomEye insecurely.

Mandatory Fixes (ALL REQUIRED)

Remove ALL hardcoded credentials

"gagan" DB password

Test signing keys

Default secrets of any kind

Installer must FAIL-CLOSED

If required env vars are missing → exit non-zero

If weak secrets are detected → exit non-zero

If signing keys are missing → exit non-zero

Runtime trust alignment

Core startup must validate:

DB credentials present

Signing keys present

No test/default secrets

Core must refuse to start if validation fails

systemd alignment

systemd units must NOT start services if validation fails

No silent fallbacks

Files You MUST Inspect & Fix

(quote exact paths and lines)

installer/core/install.sh

installer/linux-agent/install.sh

installer/dpi-probe/install.sh

core/runtime.py (or equivalent startup validator)

Any shared secret utility used by installer/runtime

Evidence Required in Your Response

You MUST provide:

Exact code diffs

Before vs After behavior

Failure paths demonstrated

Why this satisfies Validation Files 01, 02, 13

If ANY hardcoded secret remains → your response is INVALID.

Do NOT proceed beyond Phase 0.
